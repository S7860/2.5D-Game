2.5D Game 

The 2.5D game is a top down game, which utilizes a 3D landscape where the player is following a wood path to kill zombies when they are spawning. The zombies appear in waves, when the first wave of zombies dies the new one appears, which are faster than the previous wave. As the number of waves increases, so does the difficulty of the game. The game continues until the player dies; also the system records the number of enemies that were killed so the player can continue to play until the previous score was overtaken by the player.
